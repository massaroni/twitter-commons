These are the Twitter Python commons: implementations of common libraries in
use throughout Twitter's codebase.

With the exception of twitter.common.python, all should be released in
lockstep.  This entails incrementing the VERSION file within this directory,
then running build-support/commons/scripts/build_py_commons.sh and uploading
the resulting source distributions to PyPI.
